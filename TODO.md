## Estimate
The decompiled file has ~115K lines of C. If we take ~15K lines to be rubbish, this can be round to ~100K. Considering a low estimate of 200 lines per day, the whole process could take up to 500 days which is quite a bit but not impossible. Now considering a high estimate of 1K lines per day, it could take 100 days which is also quite a bit.
